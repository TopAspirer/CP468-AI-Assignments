--------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
Running 8-puzzle benchmark...
  Puzzles: 100 | Shuffle moves: 50 | Seed: 42

Test 2: Running the 15-puzzle problem
Test was done by: Lloyd Nsambu, on a windows machine
--------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
Running 15-puzzle benchmark...
  Puzzles: 100 | Shuffle moves: 40 | Seed: 42
=======================================================
  Generating 100 controlled puzzles (h3 in [8, 20])...
  Running h1 on 100 puzzles...
    [h1] Completed 25/100 (skipped so far: 7)
    [h1] Completed 50/100 (skipped so far: 12)
    [h1] Completed 75/100 (skipped so far: 16)
    [h1] Completed 100/100 (skipped so far: 18)
    [h1] Skipped 18 puzzles (node limit reached)
    [h1] NOTE: h1 skipping puzzles on the 15-puzzle is EXPECTED.
    [h1]       h1's loose lower bound forces A* to explore an
    [h1]       exponentially larger search space. This is a key
    [h1]       finding demonstrating why stronger heuristics matter.
  Running h2 on 100 puzzles...
    [h2] Completed 25/100 (skipped so far: 0)
    [h2] Completed 50/100 (skipped so far: 0)
    [h2] Completed 75/100 (skipped so far: 1)
    [h2] Completed 100/100 (skipped so far: 1)

This took a considerable amount of time to solve!... thought my machine had froze for a second.
Below are the results from running both algorithims:

  HEURISTIC PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
========================================================================

8-puzzle:
----------------------------------------
  h1: 11649.5 avg nodes expanded
  h2: 1135.0 avg nodes expanded
  h3: 628.6 avg nodes expanded ← best

  Summary:
  - h1 (Misplaced Tiles): weakest heuristic; loose lower bound,
    A* explores far more nodes. On the 15-puzzle, h1 frequently
    fails to solve instances within the node limit. This is
    EXPECTED and demonstrates h1's practical inadequacy for
    large search spaces, not a bug in the implementation.
  - h2 (Manhattan Distance): dominates h1 (h2 >= h1 for all
    states). Significantly fewer nodes expanded, solves all
    benchmark instances reliably.
  - h3 (Linear Conflict): dominates h2 (h3 >= h2 for all states).
    Tightest lower bound of the three; fewest nodes expanded
    and fastest solve times across both puzzle sizes.

15-puzzle:
----------------------------------------
  h1: 51712.2 avg nodes expanded
  h2: 9284.3 avg nodes expanded
  h3: 3692.5 avg nodes expanded ← best

  Summary:
  - h1 (Misplaced Tiles): weakest heuristic; loose lower bound,
    A* explores far more nodes. On the 15-puzzle, h1 frequently
    fails to solve instances within the node limit. This is
    EXPECTED and demonstrates h1's practical inadequacy for
    large search spaces, not a bug in the implementation.
  - h2 (Manhattan Distance): dominates h1 (h2 >= h1 for all
    states). Significantly fewer nodes expanded, solves all
    benchmark instances reliably.
  - h3 (Linear Conflict): dominates h2 (h3 >= h2 for all states).
    Tightest lower bound of the three; fewest nodes expanded
    and fastest solve times across both puzzle sizes.

  *** KEY FINDING (15-puzzle) ***
  h1 only solved 82/100 puzzles within the node limit.
  h2 solved 99/100 — a 17-puzzle improvement over h1.
  h3 solved 99/100 with 3693 avg nodes vs
  h2's 9284 — confirming linear conflict's superiority.

  Dominance relationship: h3 >= h2 >= h1 (all admissible)
  More informed heuristic → fewer nodes → faster solve time
